<p>Hi, my name is Abby and Beyond Bands is a company that I started with some help from my two sisters,  Emily and Eliza. We love making friendship bracelets, traveling, and helping the world become a better place, so we incorporated these passions into a single idea. Beyond Bands are handmade knotted bracelets, which are brought with us on adventures. Once these bracelets have traveled with us, they have more background and are then ready for YOUR adventure. Even more importantly, we believe in helping the environment, its fascinating creatures, and the people in need around us. Therefore, we send 25% of Beyond Bands' profits to a different organization each month. Sometimes, we may be donating to the "World Wildlife Foundation" (WWF), "The Perfect World Foundation," "St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital," and many other foundations. We hope you will help us on this incredible journey as we weave the world together with Beyond Bands! </p>
